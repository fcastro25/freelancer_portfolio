## WEB SCRAPING PROJECTS

### PROJECT 01 - POKEMON GO WEB SCRAPING USING PYTHON

This project consists of a python script that is capable of scrape data from a list of links.

The website choose to be scraped was the following -> [Pokemon go wiki - fandom](https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/)

Firstly a function called "link_scraper" scans the website and returns the list of links relative to each pokemon. This list is used as input parameter by the function called "info_scraper" where all available information about each pokemon is scraped. So, the scraping part of the script is a two step process and a json file is saved as a result by the function "save_json".
